# Official Add-ons

In addition to our core packages (Base and CRUD), we've developed a few packages you can install or download, that treat common use cases.

>**These add-ons only provide basic functionality.** What will be enough for _most_ projects. They do not intend to be a complete solution for all use cases. If you need to customize a package for your specific use case, you can easily do that, by copy-pasting their code in your project and modifying it. Every official package has been created with this in mind, has a very simple architecture, uses Backpack best practices. Find the "extend" section in each of their docs for more about this.
