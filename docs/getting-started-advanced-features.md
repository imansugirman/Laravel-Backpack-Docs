Here are some other cool things Backpack makes easy for you. We recommend going through them one by one, just browsing. You might not need the feature _right now_, but when _you do_, you’ll know how to find it.

- **ListEntries**
    - you can add a “+” button next to each entry, to allow the admin to easily preview some quick information that was too big to fit inside a columns - we call it [details row](/docs/crud-operation-list-entries#details-row)
    - export all visible items in the table by adding [export buttons](/docs/crud-operation-list-entries#export-buttons)
    - [custom search logic](/docs/crud-columns#custom-search-logic) for the columns in the list view


Additionally, here are a few more ways you can customize your CRUDs:
- [Custom Views for each CRUD](/docs/crud-how-to#customize-views-for-each-crud-panel)
- [Custom CSS or JS](/docs/crud-how-to#customize-css-and-js-for-default-crud-operations) for each CRUD Operation

**That’s it for today!** Told you we’re done with long lessons :-) Hopefully some of the above have peaked your interest and you’ve clicked to see what Backpack can do. In the [next lesson](/docs/getting-started-license-and-support) we’ll go through a few other Backpack packages, that cover some recurring use cases.
